# The Agile cheat sheet
> One minute to learn. The whole life to cultivate yourself

**Hi!** This cheat sheet about the Agile was created in order to revise the variety of principles and practices that 
live in the Agile\`s world, including the Agile itself, Scrum, Extreme Programming, and Kanban. I tried to
make the document succinct keeping its avail. Don\`t consider this text as a textbook. Use it for revisions.
It\`s just a cheat sheet :)

## Feedback. Happy to read.

## Foreword
![Scrum rugby](./images/scrum-rugby.jpg)

The word “Scrum” is taken from rugby and denotes a team game method that allows you to take possession of the ball and lead it further across the field, and this requires coherence, unity of intent and a clear understanding of the goal.

# I. The Agile\`s basics
> Most people in your company do their best doing their job. 
> They want their colleagues and leaders to see that they are well performing their tasks. 
> When someone reaches a certain level of comfort at work and knows it thoroughly, 
> the last thing they would like is for someone to come and make them work differently.
> — Andrew Stellman "Applied Software Project Management"

## 1. Manifesto for Agile Software Development
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software over** comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan
5. **That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.**

## 2. 12 principles behind the Agile
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. Keep it simple, stupid. You aren`t gonna need it. The simpler, the better.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# II. Scrum
> A Pig and a Chicken are walking down the road.
  The Chicken says: "Hey Pig, I was thinking we should open a restaurant!"
  Pig replies: "Hm, maybe, what would we call it?"
  The Chicken responds: "How about 'ham-n-eggs'?"
  The Pig thinks for a moment and says: "No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved."

## 1. Scrum\`s values
1. **Commitment.** Members personally commit to achieving the goals of the team.
2. **Respect.** Members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
3. **Focus.** Everyone focuses on the work.
4. **Openness.** A team agrees to be open about the work and challenges.
5. **Courage.** A team has courage to do right things and point at problems.

## 2. System
1. **Scrum blames not the player, but the system that became source of the error, and corrects it.** Changing team productivity gives a much greater effect than the productivity of individual employees.

## 3. Value
1. **Maximum efficiency.** Try to figure out how to bring the most value in the shortest time with the least effort.
2. **Product\`s concept.** This is what you can offer, sell and what you really want to do.
3. **Immediate value.** The list of tasks is endless, therefore, tasks should be selected according to the following scenario:
   * Of the greatest importance to the progress of the project.
   * Most important for the customer or future consumer.
   * Bring the maximum income.
   * The easiest way to implement.
  
## 4. Adaptivity
1. **Feedback rocks.** Sophisticated adaptive systems focus on the environment.
2. **Do not flatter yourself with your plan.** All shit, and it can't be worse. Make decisions at [the last responsible moment](https://innolution.com/resources/glossary/last-responsible-moment-lrm).
3. **PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act).** Plan. Follow the plan. Compare the result with expectations. Adjust the plan and method of work based on errors. Repeat.
4. **OODA cycle (Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action).** Determine where you are, be aware of the options available, make a choice and act!

## 5. Loses
1. **Elimination of losses is the first goal of management and business.** Any loss in the workflow is the crime
2. **Consistency.** Work is faster and better if you do one thing at a time.
3. **Finish what you started.** Half done does not bring value. It is more rational to take a particular task and bring it to the end.
4. **Get the result the first time.** Work should performed efficiently right away. [Test driven development](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) and [pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing) to help.
5. **Hard work creates additional work.** There is a limit to the number of reasonable decisions a person has per day. Tired employees are ineffective. The optimal work week is a little less than 40 hours.
6. **Absurdity.** Unattainable goals only cause depression.
7. **No heroism.** If heroism is needed to meet deadlines, then there is a mistake in planning.
8. **Overload.** Avoid illogical tasks, unnecessary reporting, meaningless meetings.
9. **No assholes.** The atmosphere in the team must be healthy. If the team has a toxic asshole, then you need to do something with it.

## 6. Team
1. **The Great Team.** Multifunctional, autonomous, open, free to make decisions in order to improve its capabilities.
2. **Team size.** From 3 to 9 people. If it is difficult to understand who is doing what, then the speed of work is lost.
3. **Product Owner (PO).** The main member of the team. Possesses high credentials in the company. He has managerial competencies and is versed in the product. And:
   * Responsible for setting strategic goals.
   * Identifies the main needs for the product and broadcasts them to a team.
   * Understands what functionality the team could potentially deliver.
   * Finds out which functionality is most valuable to customer, and which one is secondary.
   * Works with a team to understand which functionality is easier to create, and which is harder.
   * Uses the concept of value, uncertainty, complexity and more to help the team choose the right features for creating a product in every sprint.
   * Shares product information with other company employees to help the team prepare the next version of the product.
4. **Scrum master.** Leads the team to process improvement. Does not blame, does not punish, but collects facts and supports. Eliminates losses and provides everything necessary for working in the sprint.
5. **Member of a team.** Together with teammates decides how to accomplish tasks. Responsible for product value. Abuses to [the hallway testing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30678/hallway-usability-testing), follows the principles of Extreme Programming.

## 7. Sprint
1. **The shorter the better.** Always the same size. From a week to a month.
2. **Customer Expectations.** At the beginning of the sprint, you need to work on forming the correct expectations for the client from the next sprint.
3. **Stories.** Story is customer expectations. It must be worded correctly: “Like X, I want Y, for to Z”.
4. **Backlog.** List of all product stories and tasks ordered by importance.
5. **Scope.** List of stories and tasks for the sprint from the backlog. Scope is locked. No one changes the requirements and
   expands the list. Intervention slows down the work.
6. **Definition of Ready.** Each story must comply with the principles of [INVEST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) before taking it to sprint. PO writes DoR. [Example](https://medium.com/@morgler/what-are-dod-and-dor-in-scrum-14894e0b3d0d).
7. **Definition of Done.** A list of criteria that a task must meet in order to be considered completed. DoD is written by the team in the second part of sprint planning. [Example](https://medium.com/@morgler/what-are-dod-and-dor-in-scrum-14894e0b3d0d).
8. **Assessment of tasks.** Use [poker planning with the Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) to evaluate tasks.
9. **PO is responsible for the volume of a sprint.** If any team member understands that the sprint is in danger, the team will immediately notify the PO. He communicates with customers - and adjusts scope. If the team understands that it will finish the sprint before the end of the sprint, then you can expand the scope from the backlog.
10. **Watch the dynamics.** Every team should know how much work it does per sprint.
11. **Dynamics x time = result.** Having learned the dynamics of the team, we can assume the end of the project.
12. **How to carry out an effective planning:**
   * The team answers two questions: 
      * What the team will deliver to the customer in this sprint?
      * How the team will finish its work?
   * The team follows the rules:
      * Starting with backlog means starting with users.
      * Be realistic in evaluating what you can deliver to customer.
      * Change the plan if necessary. Plans are worthless, but planning is necessary.
      * Make everyone talk about product value.
   * The team follows the rules:
      * The meeting is divided into two parts, up to four hours each for a monthly sprint.
      * PO prioritizes backlog.
      * In the first part, the PO with the team selects the stories that will be delivered at the end of the sprint, based on their significance and estimation of the amount of work. Estimation is based on [poker planning with the Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker). For each story DoR is formulated.
      * The team captures Scope and promises to show the product at the end of the sprint, including the entire Scope.
      * In the second part, the team splits stories into individual tasks that will actually be performed. For each task, DoD is formulated.
      * The team starts to work. No tasks distributed at the start of the sprint. Each person independently takes the next task as soon as he finishes the previous one.

## 8. Daily meeting
1. **Linus`s law.** With enough eyes, every errors lie on the surface.
2. **Rules.** Performed standing. At the same time in the morning. At the scrum board. No more than 15 minutes. The whole team must be present. The presence of users and stakeholders is encouraged, but they should not interfere.
3. **Principles.** The team must follow the following principles:
   * Take the example from the Pig.
   * Lead a discussion about the tasks live.
   * Alternate the right to direct the work of the team. Choose a host.
   * Do not take it as a ritual.
   * Everybody participates.
   * Do not treat this as a status-meeting.
   * Check every task.
   * Change the plan, if necessary, with the participation of PO.
4. **Questions.** Scrum-master sets the following the questions:
   * What did you do yesterday to help the team complete the sprint?
   * What will you do today to help the team complete the sprint?
   * What are the barriers to the team?
5. **Changes.** Next, the team updates the scrum board and graphics. If questions arise that require discussion, an additional meeting is immediately organized.
