# The Agile cheat sheet
> One minute to learn. The whole life to cultivate yourself

**Hi!** This cheat sheet about the Agile was created in order to revise the variety of principles and practices that 
live in the Agile\`s world, including the Agile itself, Scrum, Extrem Programming, and Kanban. I tried to
make the document succinct keeping its avail. Don\`t consider this text as a textbook. Use it for revisions.
It\`s just a cheat sheet :)

## Feedback. Happy to read.

## Foreword
![Scrum rugby](./images/scrum-rugby.jpg)

The word “Scrum” is taken from rugby and denotes a team game method that allows you to take possession of the ball and lead it further across the field, and this requires coherence, unity of intent and a clear understanding of the goal.

# I. The Agile\`s basics
> Most people in your company do their best doing their job. 
> They want their colleagues and leaders to see that they are well performing their tasks. 
> When someone reaches a certain level of comfort at work and knows it thoroughly, 
> the last thing they would like is for someone to come and make them work differently.
> — Andrew Stellman "Applied Software Project Management"

## 1. Manifesto for Agile Software Development
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software over** comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan
5. **That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.**

## 2. 12 principles behind the Agile
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. Keep it simple, stupid. You aren`t gonna need it. The simpler, the better.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# II. Scrum
> A Pig and a Chicken are walking down the road.
  The Chicken says: "Hey Pig, I was thinking we should open a restaurant!"
  Pig replies: "Hm, maybe, what would we call it?"
  The Chicken responds: "How about 'ham-n-eggs'?"
  The Pig thinks for a moment and says: "No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved."

## 1. Scrum\`s values
1. **Commitment.** Members personally commit to achieving the goals of the team.
2. **Respect.** Members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
3. **Focus.** Everyone focuses on the work.
4. **Openness.** A team agrees to be open about the work and challenges.
5. **Courage.** A team has courage to do right things and point at problems.

## 2. System
1. **Scrum blames not the player, but the system that became source of the error, and corrects it.** Changing team productivity gives a much greater effect than the productivity of individual employees.

## 3. Value
1. **Maximum efficiency.** Try to figure out how to bring the most value in the shortest time with the least effort.
2. **Product\`s concept.** This is what you can offer, sell and what you really want to do.
3. **Immediate value.** The list of tasks is endless, therefore, tasks should be selected according to the following scenario:
  * Of the greatest importance to the progress of the project.
  * Most important for the customer or future consumer.
  * Bring the maximum income.
  * The easiest way to implement.
