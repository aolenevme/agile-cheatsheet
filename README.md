# The Agile Cheat sheet
> One minute to learn. The whole life to cultivate yourself

Hi! This cheat sheet about the Agile was created in order to revise the variety of principles and practices that 
live in the Agile\`s world, including the Agile itself, Scrum, Extrem Programming, and Kanban. I tried to
make the document succinct keeping its avail. Don\`t consider this text as a textbook. Use it just for revisions.
It\`s just a cheat sheet :)

## Feedback. Happy to read.
