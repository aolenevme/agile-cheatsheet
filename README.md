# The Agile cheat sheet
> One minute to learn. The whole life to cultivate yourself

Hi! This cheat sheet about the Agile was created in order to revise the variety of principles and practices that 
live in the Agile\`s world, including the Agile itself, Scrum, Extrem Programming, and Kanban. I tried to
make the document succinct keeping its avail. Don\`t consider this text as a textbook. Use it just for revisions.
It\`s just a cheat sheet :)

## Feedback. Happy to read.

## 1. Manifesto for Agile Software Development
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software over** comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan
5. **That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.**
